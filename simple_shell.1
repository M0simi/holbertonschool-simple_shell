.SH NAME
simple_shell \- a simple UNIX command line interpreter
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ./hsh
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B simple_shell
is a basic implementation of a UNIX command-line interpreter that mimics the behavior of the Bourne shell. It accepts user input, parses commands, and executes them using system calls.

.SH USAGE
- Run the shell in interactive mode by simply executing:
  ./hsh

- Run the shell in non-interactive mode by piping input:
  echo "ls" | ./hsh

.SH FEATURES
- Executes commands with full path or found in PATH
- Supports built-in commands like:
    - exit
    - env
- Handles input/output errors gracefully

.SH OPTIONS
Currently, the shell does not accept any command-line options.

.SH EXAMPLES
Interactive:
  \fB$ ./hsh\fR
  \fB($) ls -l\fR
  \fB($) exit\fR

Non-interactive:
  \fB$ echo "ls -l" | ./hsh\fR
